Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community! Four quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

### Algorithm and Data Structure in Python
This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures in Python. The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of algorithms and data structures that are easy to understand and implement. The algorithms and data structures are implemented in Python and are accompanied by a README file that explains the algorithm and data structure in detail.

This repository is split into three sections:
- Easy
In this section, you will find algorithms and data structures that are easy to understand and implement. These algorithms and data structures are a good starting point for beginners. There will 40 problems in this section.

- Medium
In this section, you will find algorithms and data structures that are a bit more complex than the ones in the Easy section. These algorithms and data structures are a good starting point for intermediate programmers. There will be 20 problems in this section.

- Hard
In this section, you will find algorithms and data structures that are more complex than the ones in the Medium section. These algorithms and data structures are a good starting point for advanced programmers. There will be 10 problems in this section.
